**Amazon Clone – HTML Only (No CSS/JS)**

This is a simple Amazon-like website clone built entirely using pure HTML only — no CSS or JavaScript is used. All navigation and styling are handled using basic HTML tags and attributes like <font>, color, size, etc.

 Features

✅ Login Page with username and password fields

✅ Home Page displaying product list with links

✅ Product Details Page for each product

✅ Back Arrow to return from product page to home

✅ Single HTML File (easy to submit)

✅ No CSS or JavaScript – basic styling using only HTML

How It Works

1)Clicking the "Sign In" button on the login form navigates to the home page (#home).

2)Clicking on a product name opens its details section using anchor links (#product1, #product2, etc.).

3)Each product detail page includes a "Back to Home" link to return.

Usage
1)Download or copy the HTML file (amazon_clone.html).

2)Open it in any web browser.

3)Navigate through the login, homepage, and product detail sections.
